# Low-frequency-STN-LFP-emotional-processing


This is the code that was used for all time-frequency and behavioral analyses for the paper :

Low-frequency subthalamic neural oscillations are involved in explicit and implicit facial emotional processing - a local field potential study

It is mostly inspired by Mike X Cohen's code based on published equation described in his book: Analyzing neural time series (MIT Press). 
There's definitely room for improvement, but the code does correct computations.
